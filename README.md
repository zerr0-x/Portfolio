This is a collection of work from my experience in the techNL Digital Skills Bootcamp, 2024.

## Basic Calculator
A calculator that lets you add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.
### Known Bugs/'Issues'
1. Can't input more than two numbers
2. Can only do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Number Guessing Game
A game you can play with AI that lets you guess a number from a pre-determined set of numbers.

### Known Bugs/'Issues'
1. From what I remember, the number you have to guess is randomized, but the number set you can guess from (ex, 1-10) is not.

## Makecode Arcade Maze Game
A maze game I made in Makecode Arcade that gets updated when I learn how to code something.
#### Known Bugs/'Issues'
1. If you somehow manage it, you may end up in a situation where you are stuck at spawn because of the enemies. If you do, currently all you can do is just reset your game.
